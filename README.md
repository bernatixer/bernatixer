### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Bernat Torres!

I'm currently working as a software engineer at @Glovo. I'm a computer science graduate at Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya and I'm currently co-directing HackUPC. I love technology and I'm always up to hear from new projects and ideas so feel free to contact me :D
